## Steps to Set Up

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/markdown-notepad.git
cd markdown-notepad
```


### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors requests
```

These libraries are required to run the local Flask proxy server.

### 3. Start the Flask Proxy Server

Inside your project folder, run:

```bash
python proxy_server.py
```

You should see:

```plaintext
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
* Press CTRL+C to quit
```

 Your proxy server is now ready and listening on port 5000.

### 4. Start Ollama Server and Load Gamma 1B Model

In a separate terminal window:

```bash
ollama serve
```

or directly run:

```bash
ollama run gamma:1b
```

 This ensures that the LLM is ready to accept summarization requests.
